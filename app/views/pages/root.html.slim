    p Welcome to your newly generated rails application...

  p Meander around the code to see what's been done for you. Many small, and a few not-so-small, customizations have been made.
  p Custom generator templates create views that are bootstrap compatible and specs that are factory-aware and follow best practices.

    p Your application is ready for easy deployment to heroku.
