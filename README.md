# Development

## Getting Started

### tl;dr
One click to deploy this as a free Heroku app, but note that you'll need to perform the setup below to work on it locally.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Requirements

To run the specs or fire up the server, be sure you have these installed (and running):

* Ruby 2.3 (see [.ruby-version](.ruby-version)).
* PostgreSQL 9.x (`brew install postgresql`) with superuser 'postgres' with no password (`createuser -s postgres`).
* PhantomJS 2.x for Capybara and Javascript testing (`brew install phantomjs`).

### First Time Setup

After cloning, run [./bin/setup](bin/setup) to install missing gems and prepare the database.

Note, `rake db:sample_data` (run as part of setup) loads a small set of data for development. Check out
[db/sample_data.rb](db/sample_data.rb) for details.

### Running the Specs

To run all Ruby and Javascript specs.

    $ ./bin/rake

Note: `./bin/rake` runs the springified version of rake (there's a `./bin/rspec` and `./bin/rails` too). You can add
`./bin` to your PATH too, then you'll always use the springified bins when they exist. See
[rails/spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) for additional information.

### Running the Application Locally

    $ foreman start
    $ open http://localhost:3000

## Conventions

### Git

* Branch `development` is auto-deployed to acceptance.
* Branch `master` is auto-deployed to production.
* Create feature branches off of `development` using the naming convention
  `(features|chores|bugs)/a-brief-description-######`, where ###### is the tracker id.
* Rebase your branch before merging into `development` to produce clean merge bubbles.
* Retain merge commits for multi-commit branches when merging into `development` (e.g. `git merge --no-ff branchname`).
* Craft atomic commits that make sense on their own and can be easily cherry-picked or reverted if necessary.

### Code Style

Generally speaking, follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). Additionally, these are
other guidelines adopted by the team:

**Always use double quotes for test/spec descriptions, unless the subject is a class/module.**

```ruby
describe SomeController do
  context "when logged in as an admin" do
    describe "#some_method" do
      it "does some thing"
    end
  end
end
```

## Additional/Optional Development Details

### Code Coverage (local)

Coverage for the ruby specs:

    $ COVERAGE=true rspec

Code coverage is reported to Code Climate on every CI build so there's a record of trending.

### Using Guard

Guard is configured to run ruby and jasmine specs, and also listen for livereload connections.

    $ bundle exec guard

### Using Mailcatcher

    $ gem install mailcatcher
    $ mailcatcher
    $ open http://localhost:1080/

Learn more at [mailcatcher.me](http://mailcatcher.me/). And please don't add mailcatcher to the Gemfile.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment with CircleCI

This project is configured for continuous integration and deployment with CircleCI and Heroku.

Check out [circle.yml](circle.yml) and [bin/deploy.sh](bin/deploy.sh) for details.

# Server Environments

### Hosting

Acceptance and Production are hosted on Heroku under the _email@example.com_ account.

### Environment Variables

Several common features and operational parameters can be set using environment variables.

**Required**

* `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - Secret key base for verfying signed cookies. Should be 30+ random characters and secret!

**Optional**

* `HOSTNAME` - Canonical hostname for this application. Other incoming requests will be redirected to this hostname.
* `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` - Enable basic auth with this password.
* `BASIC_AUTH_USER` - Set a basic auth username (not required, password enables basic auth).
* `PORT` - Port to listen on (default: 3000).
* `PUMA_WORKERS` - Number of puma workers to spawn (default: 1).
* `PUMA_THREADS` - Threads per worker (default: 5).
* `DB_POOL` - Number of DB connections per pool (i.e. per worker) (default: PUMA_THREADS or 5).
* `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` - Log to standard out (default: false).

### Third Party Services

* Heroku for hosting.
* CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment.
